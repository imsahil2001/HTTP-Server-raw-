This is a raw HTTP server completey build from Java only

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, I built a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.


So here comes the actual stuff!

# To run and test the server

Follow the mentioned points to .

1. Ensure you have `java (21)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_server.sh` from the program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
1. You can check the endpoints including with the methods and you will receive the proper response from the server in a format which is protocol for all servers to respond with.
